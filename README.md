# The One Line List
## What's This? 
This is my list of development related stuff, with one line descriptions I came up to go with it. 

I've deliberately limited it's descriptions to be only a one liner, as it's only meant to remind me what it is. It's probably horribly inaccurately described.

## Contents

- [General Web Development Tools](#general-web-development-tools)
- [Music related libraries and programs](#music-related-libraries-and-programs)
